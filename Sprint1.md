What issues your team planned to address:
Create the chat interface between users
Create the a panel where users can see all their conversations 
Being able to have a clutter free layout for the app and allow users to easily navigate the app and a basic login/authentication screen for the app.
Develop a Database were we can store user and messages information
Create a restAPI with basic GET, POST, PUT functionaliities



Which ones were successfully completed:
The issue that was completed would be setting up the basic layout of the app and having an organized setup. 
We were able to develop a basic chat interface on how a conversation panel would look like for our users.
 

Which ones didn't and why?
We weren't able to implement the login screen because we are not yet well-versed with the process. As we progress, we will be able to implement this issue.
