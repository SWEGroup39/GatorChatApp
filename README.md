- Project Description:

  - Create a full-stack application that operates as a general messaging platform for users.

    - Below are a list of general/required features we would like to implement (should be able to implement within our time frame):

      - Login system with authentication.
      - Send text messages to other contacts on the application.
        - Messages have timestamps associated with them.
      - Can send images.
      - Able to edit/delete messages.
      - Ability to search past messages.
      - List of contacts with easy contact import and editing functionality.
      - Notifications, unread message counts, and/or message states (read/unread).
      - User presence indication (available, away, offline, time last active).

    - Below are additional features that we would implement if time permits:

      - Have the messaging app be geared towards the computer science community or UF students in general.

        - If we went down the CS community track, the features we would add would be:

          - Prioritize the app to be able to share information such as code in a visually appealing way (make it look like an idea).
          - Syntax highlighting for code snippets that are shared within the messaging app.
          - A built-in code editor for writing/sharing code within the app.
          - An ability to create and share diagrams and flowcharts.

      - Other general additional features include:

        - Ability to send voice notes.
        - Ability to reply to a message with emojis.
